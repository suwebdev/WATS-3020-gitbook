# Conclusion

This is another one of those books where the end is really just the beginning. 

We have covered the basics of what programming is, where it came from, and how we got to where we are now. We have done a whirlwind tour of the general landscape of software development and the kinds of programming languages used in various niches of the industry. We have considered common features of languages and which features are more defining than others.

We have jumped feet-first into the deep waters of JavaScript and ECMAScript 6, learning the latest methods and the most fundamental techniques. We have covered syntax, style, variables, data types, and other basics of the language. We have learned about conditionals and loops and functions. We extended our understanding into the realm of Object Oriented Programming and further enhanced the usefulness of all of these big concepts by practicing how to manipulate the Document Object Model and respond to user interaction.

Together, we have covered the basics that are required to do a remarkable amount of work with JavaScript in the web browser. We can use these skills to enhance web pages effectively and build complex interactive experiences. We can better understand code written by others and can begin to leverage their work to make ours better.

We have done a lot in a short amount of time. If you have come all this way with us, then you deserve congratulations.

But you also deserve encouragement, because we have only begun a journey towards proficiency with JavaScript. There are so many more things to learn, so many challenges to overcome, and so much work to do. We have not covered _everything_, and we have not learned it _all_. To name a few of the very important things that we have _not_ covered, there are:

* Arrow Functions
* Importing and Exporting Modules
* Using AJAX design patterns to request data
* Working with localStorage and cookies
* Architecting complex web applications
* Optimizing JavaScript delivery and performance
* and so much more...

We must keep at it. This foundation will serve us well, and we are in a good position to build, grow, and develop into the creators we want to be. There are many resources out there that can push your knowledge further. Take full advantage of them to keep learning and you will accomplish all of your goals.
