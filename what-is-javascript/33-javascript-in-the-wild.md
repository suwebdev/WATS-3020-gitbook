# JavaScript in the Wild

JavaScript has burst past the boundaries of web browsers and even web servers. It lives on operating systems and in devices all over the world. It is used for all sorts of tasks beyond just creating and serving web pages. As web technology becomes embedded throughout our world, and screens are increasingly powered by open web standards, JavaScript will always play a role in the software we create.

## Non-Browser-Based JavaScript Engines

In order to make JavaScript run everywhere, it's crucial to have a JavaScript engine that can run on your hardware. Several projects have been created to do just that: Allow JavaScript programs to execute like regular applications. These are some of the most popular non-browser-based JavaScript engines in use today.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino)
* [MynaJS](http://www.mynajs.org/)

## Scripting in Apps

Many applications allow users to create scripts using JavaScript to automate features or tasks. The following applications all allow for this sort of scripting:

* [Adobe Creative Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite)
* [Chrome Web Browser Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome)
* [RPG Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG_Maker)
* [Google Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Apps_Script)

## Application Development

JavaScript is increasingly used in application development for outside the browser. [Apache's Cordova project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova) is a JavaScript-based framework for allowing developers to create native mobile applications using web technologies. The [Unity game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28game_engine%29) allows JavaScript to be used as a language for creating platform native games, too.

## Hardware Hacking

The popularity of JavaScript-based platforms like Node.js have even led to JavaScript being used as the primary programming language for self-contained hardware projects. Devices like the [Tessel](https://tessel.io/) run Node.js as a platform and allow JavaScript developers to create software that can control a wide array of devices and sensors.
