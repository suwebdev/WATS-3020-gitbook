# Extra Practice

Remember: Learning to program takes practice! It helps to see concepts over and over, and it's always good to try things more than once. We learn much more the second time we do something. Use the exercises and additional self-checks below to practice.

```js
// Refer to this code to answer the questions.
let x = 12;
let y = 3;

let z = x % y;

let foo = 5;
x = 16;
let bar = x % foo;

/* let z = 42; */

let baz = z + bar;
